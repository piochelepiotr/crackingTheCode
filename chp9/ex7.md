Is it possible to get read only credentials on a bank account?

store these read only credentials in a database
do a crawling job to get the results


database: userID, credentials, email, spending history

crawler  -- spending report, userID --> analyzer -- recommendations --> notifier (email, messages, etc)

Group people in categories, group by amount received.
then, do sub groups by amount spent, check what people with positive cashflows are spending on each category
for people that have negative cashflows, look at what category they are spending the most compared to others. Recommend to spend less on that category, check that it isn't medical expensise, or anything not actionnable
