# Chapter 4

- Binary tree
- Binary search tree
- Balanced tree
- Complete tree (perfect except last line)
- Full Binary tree (0 or 2 children)
- Perfect Binary tree

## Binary heaps

keep a complete tree
to insert, add at the end, swap with parent if smaller until the root
to delete, swap with smallest children until the end
=> O(n ln(n)) for all operations

## Tries (prefix trees)

used for autocompletion for instance

## Graphs

check Depth-first search and Breadth-first search
bidirectionnal search can be used to go quicker for shortest path
