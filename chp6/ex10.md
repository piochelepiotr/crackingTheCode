we can divide by two each time.
Can we do better? Certainly
we can know in 1 week by dividing correcly. Each test can test 500 bottles

actually, if we write the 1000 possibilities that (the poison is in bottle i)
each test can be a bit in this number, and that's it
so by doing the 10 tests, we know the 10 digits, we know exactly which bottle has the poison
